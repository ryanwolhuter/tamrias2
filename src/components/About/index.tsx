          <p>I'm a nervous wreck until I get behind the decks.
            All I give a fuck about is Ableton and sex</p>

          <p>If you met me, you'd probably say 'Hi'
            and I don't have a problem with that. Yet.</p>

          <p>If you're thinking about giving me money, just
            fucking do it already.</p>

          <p>I live off chocolate, sleeping pills, and weed. Will
            accept payment in money or all of the above</p>

          <p>I'm Ryan's favourite friend. He loves me, and
            you should too.</p>

          <p>Seriously gimme some fuckin money.</p>
